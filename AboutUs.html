    <p class="article3">I'm Mr. Doppleganger, and I'm 47 years old. I came to the USA as a child with my parents in 1980. My parents opened our first bed and breakfast that year, marking the start of our family's hospitality business.
        Over the years, we expanded to open three other bed and breakfast establishments in small towns across the Midwest. While each property has its own unique charm and surroundings, they all share the same welcoming atmosphere that we strive to provide to our guests.
        I now run this bed and breakfast with my wife Frances and our two daughters.
        With over 40 years of experience running charming, family-owned establishments, we view each guest as part of our extended family. Our cozy B&B will feel like your Home Away from Home. From the freshly-cooked breakfasts to fresh sheets, we provide the thoughtful service and amenities to make your stay truly memorable.
        We can't wait for you to become part of our story here in O'Fallon! Please explore our site to see photos, and book your upcoming stay at our little slice paradise.</p>
